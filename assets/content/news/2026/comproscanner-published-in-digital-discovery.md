# ComProScanner Published in Digital Discovery

We are delighted to announce that **Aritra Roy's** research on **ComProScanner** has been published in [_Digital Discovery_](https://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/digital-discovery), a journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry. This work represents a major contribution to automated scientific data extraction and a key milestone in Aritra's PhD at [London South Bank University](https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/).

## The Research

The paper, titled **"ComProScanner: a multi-agent based framework for composition-property structured data extraction from scientific literature"**, presents an autonomous multi-agent platform for extracting, validating, and visualising machine-readable chemical compositions and properties from journal articles, creating structured, ML-ready databases with no human intervention.

### Key Features

- **Publisher-to-database pipeline** via Text and Data Mining (TDM) APIs from Elsevier, Springer Nature, IOP Publishing, and Wiley — no manual PDF uploads required
- **Five specialised AI agents** organised into a RAG-based filtering crew, a composition extraction crew, and a synthesis information crew
- **Variable composition resolution** using a deep learning tool to expand formulas like Na(1−x)LixTiO₃ into distinct compounds
- **Built-in evaluation framework** with weight-based accuracy, classification metrics, and novel normalised classification metrics
- **Implementable in fewer than 20 lines of Python code** via `pip install comproscanner`

### Results

The framework was benchmarked on 100 journal articles across 10 LLMs for extracting piezoelectric material compositions and d₃₃ coefficient values. **DeepSeek-V3-0324** achieved the best overall accuracy of **0.82**, with a compositional accuracy of **0.90**. Strikingly, over 99% of the extracted piezoelectric materials are absent from the Materials Project database, highlighting the untapped wealth of data buried in the literature.

### Significance

ComProScanner establishes a scalable, user-friendly pathway for building large experimental datasets from journal articles, directly addressing one of the core bottlenecks in data-driven materials discovery. By combining LLM agents with RAG, domain-specific embeddings, and publisher APIs, it bridges the gap between unstructured scientific literature and machine learning pipelines.

## About the Authors

This work was led by **Aritra Roy**, a PhD student in the Energy, Materials and Environment Research Centre at LSBU, under the supervision of **Prof. John Buckeridge** (LSBU) and **Dr. Chiara Gattinoni** (King's College London), with contributions from **Prof. Enrico Grisan** (LSBU). Financial and legal support for publisher TDM licences was provided by LSBU and KCL. Dr. Gattinoni's work was supported by the EPSRC New Investigator Award [grant number UKRI132].

## Looking Ahead

ComProScanner is fully open source and available for the community to use, extend, and adapt to new properties and material systems. Future directions include integrating OCR and vision-language models to extract data from figures and graphs, and extending the framework to support extraction of multiple material properties simultaneously.

Congratulations to Aritra on this excellent work!
