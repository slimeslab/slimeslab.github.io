# First PhD Publication by Md. Maruf Mridha

We are thrilled to announce the first PhD publication by **Md. Maruf Mridha**, published in _The Journal of Physical Chemistry C_. This significant achievement marks an important milestone in Maruf's doctoral research on carbon nitride photocatalysts.

## The Research

The paper, titled **"Using Dynamics to Determine the Ground State Properties of g-C3N4"**, presents a novel computational approach to understanding the complex structural properties of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a promising material for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

### Key Findings

Graphitic carbon nitride has attracted significant attention as a metal-free photocatalyst due to its:

- **Visible light absorption** capabilities
- **Chemical stability** under various conditions
- **Tunable electronic properties**
- **Earth-abundant composition** (carbon and nitrogen)

However, determining the true ground state structure of g-C3N4 has been a long-standing challenge in materials science. Different synthesis methods and computational approaches have led to conflicting predictions about which structural form is most stable.

### Innovative Methodology

This research employed **molecular dynamics simulations** combined with **density functional theory (DFT)** calculations to investigate the structural preferences of g-C3N4 at finite temperatures. By simulating the material's behavior under realistic conditions, the study provides insights that go beyond conventional static calculations.

The key innovation lies in using dynamic simulations to:

1. **Explore multiple structural configurations** that can exist at room temperature
2. **Account for thermal effects** that influence structural stability
3. **Identify energy barriers** between different structural forms
4. **Predict which structures are experimentally accessible**

### Significance for Photocatalysis

Understanding the ground state structure of g-C3N4 is crucial for:

- **Optimizing photocatalytic efficiency** for hydrogen production
- **Designing better synthesis routes** to target specific structures
- **Predicting optical and electronic properties** more accurately
- **Developing next-generation solar fuel technologies**
