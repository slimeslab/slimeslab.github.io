# MADD Day Trip to Surrey Hills

On a beautiful September day, the MADD (Materials Analysis, Design and Discovery) research group embarked on an exciting day trip to the Surrey Hills, one of England's most stunning Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

## A Day in Nature

The trip provided a perfect opportunity for team members to step away from the lab and enjoy the great outdoors. We explored scenic walking trails, enjoyed panoramic views of the countryside, and experienced the tranquility of nature.

## Team Building

Beyond the natural beauty, the trip served as an excellent team-building exercise. Group members had the chance to:

- Connect with colleagues in a relaxed, informal setting
- Share experiences and stories outside the academic environment
- Strengthen collaborative bonds that enhance our research work
- Recharge and refresh before diving back into our projects

## Memorable Moments

The day was filled with memorable moments:

- **Morning hike**: We started with an invigorating hike through wooded trails
- **Scenic lunch**: A picnic lunch with breathtaking views of the rolling hills
- **Evening reflections**: Sharing highlights of the day on the journey back

## Looking Forward

Events like these remind us that great research comes not just from individual brilliance, but from strong teams that support and inspire each other. We look forward to more such outings that help us grow both professionally and personally.
